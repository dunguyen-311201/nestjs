### Done
- Reviewed `docs/01-ERD.md` PARCEL vs PROOF_OF_DELIVERY cardinality; confirmed `1:0..1` is correct per BR-04 (RTS only fires after failed attempts, never after a successful `Delivered`).
- Added deferred/out-of-scope notes for a possible future "post-delivery return" flow in `docs/01-ERD.md` and `docs/04-business-rules.md`.
- Added zone-to-zone pricing queries (current rate-card price vs. locked order price) to `queries.sql`.
- Reviewed all queries in `queries.sql` against BRs/NFRs/use cases; fixed several bugs (artificial `LIMIT 5` hiding SLA violations, `INNER JOIN` dropping never-scanned parcels, wrong revenue filter, mislabeled `outcome` column) and added missing coverage (UC-04 order-level aggregation, BR-08 payment-gate audit, BR-06 weight-discrepancy audit, POD completeness check).
- Discovered the running `shipping_postgres` container's schema was stale vs. `init-db.sql` (missing `outcome`, `effective_from`/`effective_to`, wrong FK column name on `PROOF_OF_DELIVERY`).
- Recreated `docker-compose.yml` (postgres + redis + nats, was missing from disk), rebuilt the postgres volume so `init-db.sql` applies cleanly, and reseeded from `seed.sql`.

### In progress / blocked
-

- Added a "Daily Task Log" rule to `CLAUDE.md`: auto-update `TASKS.md` after completing any non-trivial task, without being asked.

### Decisions / open questions
- `docker-compose.yml` is new/untracked — not yet added to git, pending your call.
